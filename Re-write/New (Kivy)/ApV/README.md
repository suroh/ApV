Password Storage program ( Work in progress)

I wrote this program a couple of years ago, for all intents and purposes it works. However, it could've been done much better and I'm in the process of re-writing it from the ground up. My reasoning for putting it here is simply to have better access to it. 

But, anyone is welcome to take, use and or work on it themselves. This program was written in python and uses Kivy as the GUI framework. It accepts and stores various forms of information from a user; Website, email, username, password, description of the account etc.. That information is then encrypted and written to a file.

It's fairly self explanitory but if you have any questions just let me know. I'll be posting updates periodically untill the project is finished. I can't give you any time frame as to when updates will come.
